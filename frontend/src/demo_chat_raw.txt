5/2/18, 9:20 PM - Lotti: Hey Dirk, We still haven't met, and I think we should do that soon! This past week was super busy for me, but now I'm back to the normal amount of busy and I'm more available. Let me know when you're free!
5/2/18, 9:21 PM - Dirk: Hey Lotti, we could meet tomorrow! 
5/2/18, 9:22 PM - Dirk: I have to study because I have not been able to do a lot yet, so I will need a long break tomorrow afternoon. We could use that to meet and have a coffee downtown. I also wanted to watch the coldwater classics tomorrow, if there will be something going on. Do you want to join me for one of those? During the week I have less time, but we could also figure something out I think. 
5/2/18, 9:22 PM - Dirk: Have a good saturday evening.
5/2/18, 9:23 PM - Lotti: Yeah, I'd be down to meet up tomorrow. Send me a text tomorrow and we can figure out a good time
I am not in the Dinner group myself yet. But I can invite you soon hopefully:)
here we go. they approved me so I can invite you
5/2/18, 9:23 PM - Dirk: Thanksss
5/2/18, 9:24 PM - Lotti: I guess we can find a nicer day for the hike, do you guys agree?!
5/2/18, 9:25 PM - Dirk: so tomorrow I have this meeting at 11am, so I guess it takes about an hour or a bit longer. 
5/2/18, 9:25 PM - Dirk: As I don't know exactly I think I will just call you as soon as I get out, and then we can meet at the Dining hall. Would that work for you?
5/2/18, 9:26 PM - Lotti: Sounds good! And we can go wherever you like
5/2/18, 9:26 PM - Dirk: I don't want to go to 9/10. Thats the only Dining Hall where I have already been to. So if Merill is tasty, lets go there, if sth. is even better lets go there, you tell me.
5/2/18, 9:27 PM - Lotti: Merrill is pretty good IMO. 
5/2/18, 9:28 PM - Lotti: Just give me a call tomorrow when you're ready.
