07:57:59,<mischat>,PatH: there is no need to introduce confusion ,
07:57:59,<AZ>,We can certainly see a SPARQL dataset as a snapshot of the graph store (the graph store is mutable but the snapshot is fixed to define what's the result of a query),
07:58:47,<FabGandon>,  PatH: RDF should specify the semantic of names if there is to be an interpretation of that name,

08:10:09,<FabGandon>,danbri: are you confortable with the level of interoperability that would set?,
08:10:36,<sandro>,+1 danbri we need more interop between datastores (there is breakage when people use different styles of URIs),
08:11:10,<pfps>,I don't know how the RDF semantics is going to speak to things like timestamping downloads of RDF documents.,
08:11:38,<FabGandon>,PatH: defining the semantics will not have so much implication on the implementation that seems to be feared. The idea is not to interfere with the machinery.,
08:11:42,<davidwood>,ack PatH,
08:11:46,<danbri>,"it's something like a lack of mechanism for saying how *my* sparql store is managed.

08:30:29,<FabGandon>,danbri: what about the provenance perspective?,
08:31:10,<pfps>,the upshot of this is that the RDF WG may need a new name for what we have been calling named graphs,
08:31:27,<FabGandon>,pgroth: we care about pointing at a resource or at a graph talking about a resource.,
