13:00:40,<pchampin>,quite a few hands raise,
13:01:12,<pchampin>,"steve; and gets bitten by the fact that it is suppose to be ascii, and is often utf8 in practice",
13:02:02,<danbri> aside re naming -- I've googled all the words that begin ^quad; nothing great. Trying with ^trip ->,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplex is interesting (lots of meanings but none clash),
13:03:34,<ericP>,+1 to deprecating ntriples,
13:03:57,<pchampin>,"paul: if we redefine ntriples as a subset of turtle, don't all those issues disappear?",

13:04:59,<cygri>,oh thanks mischat,
13:05:02,<zwu2>,-1 to changes to ntriples,
13:05:16,<cygri>,zwu2: including not defining a media type for it?,
13:05:30,<zwu2>,q+,
13:06:09,<pchampin>,zwu2: we will officially object any change to ntriples,
13:06:18,<danbri>,maybe the issue here is 'change',
13:06:41,<pchampin>,david: are you parsing ntriples in ascii? are you sure?,
13:07:16,<mischat>,on the wiki page above ^^,
13:07:28,<zwu2>,ack zwu2,
13:07:33,<pchampin>,danbri thinks ntriples-is-ntriples; whatever this group does is ... the next thing,
13:07:37,<davidwood>,zwu2 confirmed that they would formally object to a change in ntriples,
13:07:39,<ivan>,q?,
13:07:41,<zwu2>,q-,
13:07:43,<sandro>,"maybe leave N-Triples alone and define \""Line-Mode Turtle\"" as the relevant Turtle subset?",
13:08:01,<davidwood>,Guus would prefer not to do that...,
13:08:09,<pchampin>,steve: about the second line (quads + terse/verbose),
13:08:24,<gavinc>,n-quads too!,
13:08:37,<pchampin>,there are a lot of turtle-like languages for quads,
13:09:01,<pchampin>,ivan: sparql update?,
13:09:26,<pchampin>,"steve: yes, sparql update allows you to express graphs that ends up being stored, so it is a serialization syntax of its own",
13:10:44,<Zakim>,+??P26,
13:10:45,<pchampin>,"guus: iirc, richard argued agains having qurtle and turtle defined in the same document",
13:11:32,<pchampin>,"cygri: as discussed this morning, if turtle is extended with quads, this will have major impact on implementation",
13:11:49,<pchampin>,so qurtle (or anything) needs a separate media type and a separate document,
13:11:52,<LeeF>,+1 to keeping graph serialization separate from turtle,
13:13:01,<pchampin>,"peter: I would prefer people consuming turtle to be ready to consume quads, though I don't expect agreement on that",
13:13:10,<davidwood>,q?,
13:14:09,<pchampin>,paul: we are moving from a specification with triples to a specification with quads,
13:14:22,<gavinc>,-1 to a turtle media type document containing more then one graph +0 to the ONLY difference being the media type,
13:14:26,<pchampin>,so why not including quads in next-turtle,
13:14:27,<webr3>,webr3 has joined #rdf-wg,
13:15:35,<gavinc>,"Not very worried about HTTP GET, a bit more worried about HTTP POST/PUT",
13:16:30,<pchampin>,"steve: what if you crawl untrusted documents, and they contain named graphs?",
13:17:03,<pchampin>,naming the graph with a URI that you care about,
13:17:53,<pchampin>,danbri: I can answer from an experience,
13:17:54,<Guus>,Guus has joined #rdf-wg,
13:18:09,<pchampin>,I took some examples about provenance,
13:18:26,<pchampin>,converted it to quads,
13:18:28,<gavinc>,"http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-http-rdf-update/#graph-management if the representation contains more then one graph, exactly what to do with these updates becomes very strange.",
13:19:33,<webr3>,"if you put quads or ng's on the web for follow your nose, then I need a 5-tuple store (then if you put that online, will need 6-tuples, etc)",
13:19:43,<pchampin>,"then was quite confused about the way to consume them,",

13:20:36,<danbri>,( parser output http://svn.foaf-project.org/foaftown/2010/prov/_output.txt ),
13:22:17,<pchampin>,steve: the rest of the slides is about sub-details of all the above,
13:23:08,<pchampin>,Note that NQuads is not strictly a subset of anything else.,
13:23:15,<LeeF>,N-Quads can't serialize empty graphs.,
13:23:57,<LeeF>,"Or if it can, I'd like to see how?",
13:24:42 <pchampin> peter: you can state that,<uri>,a :EmptyGraph,
13:24:45 <webr3> empty graph is just,<x>,"a Graph . surely, you know you have a graph, and a name for it, but nothing else",
13:25:20,<pchampin>,"ivan: back to NQuads, there is a broken symetry here",
13:25:41,<sandro>,not at all web3r.    Knowing a graph is empty is quite different from not knowing whether it is empty.,
13:26:03,<webr3>,good point,
13:26:11,<gavinc>,Open World ;) No it isn't,
13:26:19,<pchampin>,cygri: Trig and NQuads basically reuse a big part of Turtle (terms) and adds a few production rules around them.,
13:26:24,<webr3>,double good point lol,
13:27:27,<pchampin>,cygri: I don't think it is essential to many people that NTriples is a subset of turtle; same for NQuads,
13:28:17,<gavinc>,Binary RDF!! Bring it on!,
13:28:18,<pchampin>,paul: the absence of symetry makes it harder to teach,
13:28:32,<LeeF>,Is N-Quads in current use?,
13:28:35,<pchampin>,cygri: we have a lot of things on the table that make it even harder to teach,
13:28:41,<LeeF>,Or do we have flexibility to (re-)define it?,
13:28:55,<zwu2>,"yes, Oracle is using n-quads",
13:28:59,<LeeF>,"zwu2, thanks",
13:29:05,<gavinc>,"Yes, TopQuadrant is using N-Quads",
13:30:09,<pchampin>,"mischat: NQuads is very easy to parse and generate,",
13:30:30,<pchampin>,while most Trig parsers I have tried do not work well with big files,
13:30:46,<gavinc>,"Where \""big\"" is tiny",
13:30:59,<zwu2>,+1 to mischat,

13:31:55,<gavinc>,"Lee, 60 million+ triples?",
13:32:17,<gavinc>,"well, quads ;)",
13:32:24,<LeeF>,I think it's a mistake to just do N-Quads. There is real value to human-convenient syntax. We've seen that over and over with turtle (vis a vis N-triples). I don't think it's any different for quads.,
13:32:53,<LeeF>,"gavinc, yes, I believe so, though I can ask around for particular details",
13:32:54,<pchampin>,cygri: the SPARQL document manages to describe datasets without a standard syntax,
13:34:29,<pchampin>,"guus: by avoiding the quads+terse box, we lose symetry, but we normalize what is already out there",
